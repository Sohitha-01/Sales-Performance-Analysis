## 🔎 Key Analyses & Deliverables

### 1. Data Cleaning & KPI Monitoring (SQL)
- Queries to handle missing values, validate data quality, and calculate monthly KPIs.
- KPI metrics: revenue, profit margin, sales by category, and regional performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Descriptive statistics of sales and profit.
- Regional performance and category-level insights.
- Seasonal trends and profit margin distribution.

### 3. Dashboarding (Power BI)
- Interactive dashboard tracking:
  - Sales trends
  - Category performance
  - Profit distribution
  - Top customers and states

📸 *Preview:* *(Insert screenshot of your dashboard here)*

### 4. A/B Testing (Python)
- Designed an experiment to measure promotional impact.
- Evaluated performance differences between control and test groups.

### 5. Business Reporting
- Final reports created in Word/PDF for management.
- Summarized insights with business recommendations.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Top 10 states contributed ~60% of total sales.
- Certain product categories underperformed vs. targets by ~15%.
- Seasonal spikes in Q4 highlight the importance of promotions.
- A/B test showed Strategy B improved customer retention by **12%**.
